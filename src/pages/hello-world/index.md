Have you ever visited a web page and it takes forever to load up or visited a web page that sometimes keeps loading but never comes up? This is because websites are built using a lot of files like css, html, and js script and they contain numerous codes that is either automatically generated or written by a developer which makes them heavy in size.

Google takes ranking very seriously. It ranks websites according to how fast they load up and as a developer, your website should be SEO optimised which means it should be able to appear frequently on search results. This is measured by how fast your website is able to load up.

Hence, this is where minification comes to play. 


<b>What does Minify mean?</b>

To minify in general is simply the process by which unnecessary whitespaces, linebreaks, comments, delimiters, blanks and unnecessary characters are removed from code. These add to the size of the file and when removed, improves loading time and performance. 

In simple terms, minification reduces the amount of code that is transferred over the web. Minification applies to both css, html and js script. A minified file has a .min extension on  it. For example; form.min.css, animation.min.html


<b>Why is it important to minify css?</b>

The major importance of minifying css is, it boosts website performance and speed. According to Google, an extra delay of just half a second or more in search generation causes a 20% drop in traffic. Site speed affects website ranking and Google ranks websites that load faster. It also affects brand credibility and conversion rate. Minifying optimises css code to decrease size and increase load speed.
The end goal is to make the site visitor happy.
